## Question 1: Feature Importance

Based on your house price model, rank the four features from most important to least important. Explain how you determined this ranking.

**YOUR ANSWER:**
1. Most Important: age
2. square foot
3. bedrooms
4. Least Important: bathrooms

**Explanation:**
I ranked them this way because of the equation created by the data and the numbers given with age having the highest increase to price at $85706.65 and bathrooms being the lowest at $950.35, showing which ones are more important and which ones are least important.

## Question 2: Interpreting Coefficients

Choose TWO features from your model and explain what their coefficients mean in plain English. For example: "Each additional bedroom increases the price by $___"

**Feature 1:**
Each additional bathroom increases the price by $950.35.

**Feature 2:**
each additional bathroom increases the price by $3858.90.

## Question 3: Model Performance

What was your model's R² score? What does this tell you about how well your model predicts house prices? Is there room for improvement?

**YOUR ANSWER:**
My R^2 score is .9936which tells me that it is able to explain 99.36% of price variations which means that there is a .67% room for improvements.  It tells me that it is good at predicting house prices but could be slightly better.

## Question 4: Adding Features

If you could add TWO more features to improve your house price predictions, what would they be and why?

**Feature 1:**
adding a new variable to cover the total amount of rooms a house would have.

**Why it would help:**
This would help as it would add another factor to the price that could bring it even closer to an actual price and could immprove the overall prediction model by adding another thing to make it even more accurate.

**Feature 2:**
add multiple predicitions.

**Why it would help:**
To test the pridiction model and make sure everything is running properly and not just a random fluck that it worked with the first prediction.

## Question 5: Model Trust

Would you trust this model to predict the price of a house with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 3000 sq ft, and 5 years old? Why or why not? (Hint: Think about the range of your training data)

**YOUR ANSWER:**
I would trust it to pridict this because of similar numbers being covered in the training data so if it could handle those, then it should be able to handle these numbers with little difficulty showing that it could be trusted in pridicting the price of a house such as this.
